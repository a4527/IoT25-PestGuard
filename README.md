## 📝 Overview
PestGuard is an IoT-based smart pest detection and capture system designed for everyday environments such as homes, restaurants, libraries, and storage facilities. Utilizing a combination of ESP32-CAM, infrared camera (IR 850), distance sensor (GP2Y0E03), motion sensor (RCWL-0516), and microphone sensor (MAX9814), the system detects pest movement, wing flapping sounds, and presence in real time. It performs basic image recognition to identify pest types and triggers a trap or pesticide spray in the direction where pests are detected. For larger pests like cockroaches, the system sends a wireless alert to the user, enabling immediate awareness and response.

## 🔎 Use cases:
- Warehouses and Food Storage:
Enables continuous, unattended pest monitoring and extermination in areas where human access is limited or inconsistent.

- Restaurants and Cafés:
Automatically detects and captures pests in hygiene-sensitive areas, helping maintain a clean environment and protecting brand image.

- Homes (Kitchens, Living Rooms, etc.):
Provides a hands-free solution for detecting and managing pests in common residential spaces prone to infestations.

- For People with Limited Mobility:
Offers convenience and independence for elderly individuals or those with disabilities by handling pest control without requiring manual intervention.
